                        <p>
                              Gaming was my entry point to computing. I remember staying up late playing World of Warcraft with my cousin at the age of
                              8. It was in these moments of entertainment that I came to understand the power of computing.
                              This understanding bred curiosity and pushed me to eventually pursue a degree in Computer Engineering,
                              and now Data Science. Through my studies of computing, my interests have broadened from game
                              development to reducing climate change, creating tools to benefit communities, and creating
                              tools to aid artists and musicians in their creative works.

                                          The Data Science Master's program at the UVA SDS focuses on teaching students the skills to become commercially viable yet
                                          highly ethical data scientists and engineers. This includes highly focused courses
                                          covering topics in Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Bayesian Inferential Methods.
                                          My goal after finishing this degree is to have a greater understanding of how and
                                          when to ethically implement data science methods during software development.

                                          The Computer Engineering program at the UVA SEAS focuses on delivering the fundamentals of both a Computer Science and an
                                          Electrical Engineering degree. I chose to focus my elective credits on taking more
                                          Computer Science courses in topics such as Algorithms, Database Design, and Network
                                          Security to flesh out my understanding of the field as a whole. Near the end of
                                          my undergraduate education, I took Statistical Learning and Graph Theory, a course
                                          that fueled my curiosity towards Data Science, leading to my eventual pursuit of
                                          a Master's in Data Science.

                                    <p>

                                          This internship taught me what it is like to work on a tight-knit team of developers with an extensive codebase. Throughout
                                          the time I worked there, I learned how continuous integration and deployment are
                                          used in a real-world business setting on a team of both local and remote individuals.
                                          Considering the length of the internship, I reached a point where my expertise
                                          on specific topics surpassed those of my superiors. As a result, I wrote extensive
                                          documentation on how to use my code following my absence. Through the interactions
                                          with my superiors and peers, I learned that it is possible to work very hard on
                                          a product and still have a great time doing it when you have a team that works
                                          well together. While I learned a variety of technical skills, it is this sense
                                          of optimism towards my future job that is far more valuable to me than any specific
                                          technical skill that I learned along the way.

                                          This internship gave me a sense of what it is like to work at a large company with a team that handles one specific project.
                                          My team was developing a web application and needed help in organizing data for
                                          our analytical tool, which is where my job came in. As a result, I was not so much
                                          working with my team as I was asking them what they needed from the tool and then
                                          using that information to refine the end product. The culture at Genworth was very
                                          different from TwinThread due to the sheer size. TwinThread was more akin to 'extreme
                                          programming' with every member knowing what they were doing and reporting their
                                          progress to each other personally on a more frequent basis while Genworth operated
                                          closer to traditional 'agile development' with meetings every 2 weeks to go over
                                          all of the progress that each member made. Learning how to operate efficiently
                                          in this more rigid environment was something that was difficult for me, but is
                                          what I consider my most important takeaway from this experience.

                                          As a means to aid those who will be tasked with investigating the
                                          wildfires of tomorrow, we propose a new methodology for analyzing
                                          wildfire data and predicting wildfire cause. Previous attempts to
                                          predict wildfires’ causes have largely ignored information from
                                          recent fires in the area. Our novel approach applies various graphneural-network (GNN) techniques involving information about
                                          each individual fire, in addition to fires close to it spatially and
                                          temporally, to predict the cause of any given wildfire. We utilize
                                          24 years of geo-referenced wildfire data augmented with global
                                          population center data and NOAA GSOD weather data.

A few years ago I made a music visualizer in Cycling 74's Max/MSP but I wanted to build one from scratch this time in javascript. I have also been wanting to learn more about WebGL for a long time and this was my first foray into it. Try it out at the provided link and let me know what you think!

                                    Utilizing a novel webscraped dataset of over 160,000 images of ball pythons resized to 200x200px, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in Fast.ai to assign multiple 'morph' labels to input images. Including auxiliary information about each python did not boost predictive performance, neither did appending a graph neural network (GNN) onto the CNN. Ultimately, a Macro AUC of 0.9315 was achieved on our test set.

                                                My CpE capstone involved making a heat-lamp controller from scratch. The idea came from my pet reptiles Lyla and Boy, who
                                                live in enclosures with very specific temperature gradients. I decided that one way to
                                                make my capstone project fun would be to make a device that could automatically regulate
                                                the temperature in their environment by using Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) on a heat
                                                lamp. This became a difficult project since heat lamps require high amounts of current
                                                to produce heat. I liked the project so much that I made a logo for it as if it were
                                                actually on the market which is what you see as the icon. More detail can be found on

                                          <p>
                                                In the third year of my Computer Engineering degree, I took a Computer Architecture course. The goal of the course was to
                                                understand the fundamentals of a processor. The instructor chose RISC-V as our ISA as
                                                it is open source and coming into use by more manufacturers. We used VHDL, a hardware
                                                description language to design all of the steps of an instruction pipeline. This includes
                                                the Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-Back stages. We also made a few other intermediate
                                                hardware pieces that facilitate more efficient processing such as MUXes, registers, incrementors,
                                                counters, and register files.

                                                For my introduction to Engineering course in the first year of my undergraduate degree, each team was provided the Sparkfun
                                                Redbot and given free reign to make what we want with it. Our team decided that we would
                                                mount light sensors on the front left and front right of the bot and use them to move
                                                the bot to a dark area, hence the name. The bot worked by placing it down and pressing
                                                a button on its hull. It then rotated and averaged readings in cardinal directions in
                                                order to determine which direction to go to hide. On its path, it would use the sensors
                                                to turn left or right based on which direction was darker.

                                                For my Advanced Software Development course, our final project was to design a website as a group. We chose to create a sort
                                                of 'Tinder for studying', a tool to help people find study buddies around campus. Our
                                                class used Django to make the web development process easier since many students had
                                                used Python in their previous courses. We hosted our site on Heroku and performed testing
                                                using Travis CI. One of my teammates, inspired by Tinder, designed the logo you see as
                                                the icon and we stuck with it, even using it as the favicon for the site.

                                                To begin this project, I took into account my favorite games from the past and what made them feel special. I first decided
                                                that an isometric action game would be the best first step as many of my favorite games are 3d action RPGs and I might be able to implement my favorite parts of those
                                                games on a smaller scale from This perspective. I am actively working on this project in my free time, but I am working on it more as a fun project than anything I would potentially sell.

                                                This was the final game that I made for the game design course that I took in my senior year of highschool. The game utilizes
                                                procedurally-generated mazes that get larger as the player beats each level. The idea
                                                for the name 'Pyramid' came from the idea that the player starts at the top of a pyramid
                                                and is moving down inside of it, hence the square map getting larger on each level. I
                                                implemented an algorithm for making sure that a path from the spawn to the exit was always
                                                created and also implemented procedurally-generated paths for the ghost enemies. When
                                                ghosts see the player they will follow them until the player looks at them. I implemented
                                                three power-ups: one turns the player vision red and kills ghosts caught in their sight,
                                                one provides vision in all directions, and one shows the location of the exit on the
                                                map. I apologize for the quality of the gif above, I plan to replace it with gameplay
                                                footage soon. That being said, you can download the game from my GitHub and try it out
                                                yourself if you would like.

                                                both had a blast making it. Feel free to download it from my GitHub and try it out yourself.

                                                This was an intermediate project for the game design class I took as a senior in highschool. My idea was to implement some
                                                sort of strategic element that would involve the player predicting what would happen
                                                and then remove their ability to interact. This idea was implemented via the player drawing
                                                a path for one pug to reach the other pug while avoiding trappers as well as dangerous
                                                animals. During the daytime, the trappers move outwards from their initial position while
                                                the dangerous animals shrink down; during the nighttime the opposite happens. At the
                                                start of the game, the trappers and animals are placed at random and it is up to the
                                                player to chart a path for their pug that will avoid these dangerous forces, or they
                                                will lose (and their pug will never reach its pug lover).

                                                from scratch but I also enjoyed taking very old art from online libraries that were free
                                                to use and modifying them to make a new style. More of my art can be found on my weebly

                                                the designs for all of the promotional material. Each student in the class created their
                                                own icon and gave it to me, and I used Illustrator to vectorize their work into something
                                                that could be printed in high quality. We made lookbooks, pamphlets, flyers, posters,
                                                and temporary tattoos out of the icons. More of my art can be found on my weebly page.

                                                Kinetic Sound is a club at UVA that performs pieces from various backgrounds with classical instruments. The year that I
                                                was a part of the club, they wanted to include other artists as well. I became one of
                                                their graphic designers and created visual pieces that corresponded to two of their sonic
                                                pieces. Later, I created a sort of promotional handout for their show "Boundless". More

                                                In highschool I was the graphic designer for my school's robotics team, the "Mech Tech Dragons". This involved creating designs
                                                for posters, brochures, handouts, flags, pins, buttons, banners, and even redoing their
                                                branding standards altogether. This was an extremely fun experience and was one of my
                                                first experiences with graphic design. More of my art can be found on my weebly page.
